Summary:

A 25-year-old male patient presented with sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain is localized over the heart, sometimes radiating to the neck, worsens with coughing and lying down, and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and has no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, or numbness. He recently recovered from the flu but currently has no viral symptoms.

The patient has no significant past medical history, takes Tylenol occasionally, and has no allergies or prior surgeries. Notably, his father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which has caused the patient significant concern about his own symptoms. He is a healthy engineering student working part-time as a postman, lives with his mother, drinks alcohol occasionally, and does not smoke or use recreational drugs.

The healthcare provider acknowledged the patient's fears, reassured him, and planned to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function and determine the cause of the pain. The patient was advised to avoid excessive worry until test results are available.
