You will be provided with a raw text document. Your tasks are as follows:

Summarization: Generate a concise summary of the text. Capture the core message, key facts, and main points. Use a mix of extractive and abstractive summarization techniques as appropriate.

Sentiment Analysis: Identify the overall sentiment of the text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Assign a sentiment score ranging from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive), allowing for decimal values (e.g., -0.5, 0.2).

Output Format: Present the results in a clean, structured JSON format with the following fields (add any relevant fields to the metadata property you deem useful):

json
{
  "summary": "string, the concise summary of the text",
  "sentiment": "Positive | Neutral | Negative",
  "sentiment_score": "number between -1 and 1",
  "metadata": {
    "original_word_count": number,
    "summary_word_count": number,
    "compression_percentage": number
    "date_processed": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
}
