## Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to the API section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key and use it in your `.env` file

## Model Configuration

The application supports configurable OpenAI models through the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable:

**Available Models:**
- `gpt-4.1-mini` (Default - fast and efficient)
- `gpt-4o` (Most capable, higher cost)
- `gpt-4-turbo` (Good balance of capability and speed)
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` (Fast and economical)

**Setting Your Model:**
1. In your `.env` file, set: `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini`
2. Or use environment variables as shown in the installation section

**Note:** Make sure you have access to the model you specify in your OpenAI account. The application will default to `gpt-4.1-mini` if no model is specified.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set"**
- Solution: Make sure you've created the `.env` file with your API key

**2. "Rate limit exceeded"**
- Solution: Wait a few minutes before trying again, or check your OpenAI usage limits

**3. "401 Unauthorized"**
- Solution: Verify your OpenAI API key is correct and active

**4. Module not found errors**
- Solution: Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

**5. "Model not found" or "Model access denied"**
- Solution: Check that you have access to the specified model in your OpenAI account
- Try using `gpt-4.1-mini` as it's widely available
- Verify your model name in the `.env` file matches exactly

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm list`
3. Confirm your API key is set correctly
4. Check the console for detailed error messages
