# Sea Battle Game - Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the modernization and refactoring of the classic Sea Battle (Battleship) game from legacy ES5 JavaScript to modern ES6+ standards, along with the implementation of comprehensive unit testing.

## Original Codebase Analysis

The original `seabattle.js` file contained:
- **333 lines** of legacy ES5 JavaScript code
- Global variables and functions
- Imperative programming style
- No separation of concerns
- No test coverage
- Single monolithic file structure

### Key Issues Identified:
- Use of `var` declarations
- Global state management
- Tightly coupled game logic and UI
- No modularity or reusability
- Difficult to test and maintain

## Refactoring Objectives

### 1. Code Modernization
✅ **Completed**: Updated to ES6+ standards
- Converted `var` to `let`/`const`
- Implemented ES6 classes and modules
- Used arrow functions where appropriate
- Added Promise/async-await patterns
- Implemented destructuring and template literals

### 2. Architectural Improvements
✅ **Completed**: Implemented clean architecture patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divided code into focused modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class handles one primary concern
- **Encapsulation**: Private state and methods properly contained
- **Modularity**: Reusable and testable components

### 3. Code Organization
✅ **Completed**: Restructured into modular architecture

### Test Coverage by Module
| Module | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Ship.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Board.js | 97.46% | 88.46% | 100% | 98.59% |
| CPUPlayer.js | 97.33% | 97.67% | 100% | 97.14% |
| Player.js | 94.44% | 94.11% | 100% | 94.44% |
