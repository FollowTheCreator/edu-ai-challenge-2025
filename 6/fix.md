# Enigma Machine Bug Analysis and Fixes

## Summary
The Enigma machine implementation contained two critical bugs that prevented it from accurately simulating historical Enigma machine behavior. These bugs affected the core encryption/decryption functionality and would have made the implementation incompatible with real Enigma machines.

## Bug #1: Incorrect Double-Stepping Mechanism

### Problem Description
The original `stepRotors()` method did not implement the correct "double-stepping" mechanism that was a crucial feature of the historical Enigma machine.

**Original buggy code:**
```javascript
stepRotors() {
  if (this.rotors[2].atNotch()) this.rotors[1].step();
  if (this.rotors[1].atNotch()) this.rotors[0].step();
  this.rotors[2].step();
}
```

### Root Cause
The bug occurred because when the middle rotor was at its notch position, it would cause the leftmost rotor to step, but the middle rotor itself would not step in the same operation. This violated the historical double-stepping behavior where:
- When the middle rotor reaches its notch, both the middle rotor AND the leftmost rotor should step together
- This creates the famous "double-step" where the middle rotor advances twice in consecutive operations

### Impact
- Incorrect rotor positions during encryption/decryption
- Messages encrypted with this implementation could not be decrypted by historical Enigma machines
- The rotor advancement pattern would diverge from the expected sequence after the first double-step occurrence

### Fix Applied
```javascript
stepRotors() {
  // Double-stepping mechanism: if middle rotor is at notch, both middle and left rotors step
  if (this.rotors[1].atNotch()) {
    this.rotors[0].step();
    this.rotors[1].step();
  }
  // If right rotor is at notch, middle rotor steps
  if (this.rotors[2].atNotch()) {
    this.rotors[1].step();
  }
  // Right rotor always steps
  this.rotors[2].step();
}
```

### Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. When the middle rotor is at its notch → both middle and left rotors step
2. When the right rotor is at its notch → middle rotor steps
3. The right rotor always steps (normal operation)

## Bug #2: Missing Second Plugboard Application

### Problem Description
The plugboard (Steckerbrett) was only applied once during the encryption process, but in a real Enigma machine, the electrical signal passes through the plugboard twice - once on the way in and once on the way out.

**Original buggy code:**
```javascript
encryptChar(c) {
  if (!alphabet.includes(c)) return c;
  this.stepRotors();
  c = plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs);  // Only applied once!
  
  // Forward through rotors
  for (let i = this.rotors.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    c = this.rotors[i].forward(c);
  }

  // Reflector
  c = REFLECTOR[alphabet.indexOf(c)];

  // Backward through rotors
  for (let i = 0; i < this.rotors.length; i++) {
    c = this.rotors[i].backward(c);
  }

  return c;  // Missing second plugboard application!
}
```

### Root Cause
In the physical Enigma machine, the electrical circuit flows:
1. **Input** → Plugboard → Rotors → Reflector → Rotors → Plugboard → **Output**

The original implementation was missing the final plugboard application, effectively short-circuiting the plugboard's effectiveness.

### Impact
- Plugboard pairs would only affect characters on their way into the rotors
- Characters coming back from the reflector would bypass the plugboard entirely
- This significantly reduced the scrambling effect of the plugboard
- Encryption/decryption would be incorrect when plugboard pairs were used

### Fix Applied
```javascript
encryptChar(c) {
  if (!alphabet.includes(c)) return c;
  this.stepRotors();
  
  // First plugboard swap (input)
  c = plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs);
  
  // Forward through rotors (right to left)
  for (let i = this.rotors.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    c = this.rotors[i].forward(c);
  }

  // Reflector
  c = REFLECTOR[alphabet.indexOf(c)];

  // Backward through rotors (left to right)
  for (let i = 0; i < this.rotors.length; i++) {
    c = this.rotors[i].backward(c);
  }

  // Second plugboard swap (output)
  c = plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs);

  return c;
}
```

### Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. Characters are swapped by the plugboard on input
2. Characters are swapped by the plugboard again on output
3. The complete electrical path of the historical Enigma is faithfully reproduced

## Testing Strategy

The fixes were validated through comprehensive unit tests that verify:

1. **Double-stepping mechanism**: Tests ensure correct rotor advancement in all scenarios
2. **Plugboard functionality**: Tests verify that plugboard swapping occurs twice
3. **Encryption/decryption symmetry**: Tests confirm that the same settings can encrypt and decrypt messages
4. **Historical accuracy**: Tests verify that no letter encrypts to itself (fundamental Enigma property)
5. **Integration testing**: Full message encryption/decryption cycles with various settings

## Conclusion

Both bugs were critical for the correct operation of the Enigma machine simulation. The fixes restore:
- **Historical accuracy**: The implementation now matches the behavior of real Enigma machines
- **Cryptographic correctness**: Messages can be properly encrypted and decrypted
- **Interoperability**: The implementation would now be compatible with other historically accurate Enigma simulators

These fixes transform the implementation from a broken simulation into a faithful reproduction of the Enigma machine's behavior.
