## Critical Bug Fix Verification

### Bug Fix #1: Double-Stepping Mechanism
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED
- Test "double-stepping mechanism works correctly" confirms proper rotor advancement
- Test "normal stepping without double-step" validates normal operation
- Test "right rotor notch causes middle rotor step" verifies trigger condition

### Bug Fix #2: Missing Second Plugboard Application  
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED
- Test "plugboard is applied twice during encryption" confirms dual application
- Test "encryption is reversible with plugboard" validates bidirectional correctness
- Test "plugboard works without pairs" ensures no regression

## Coverage Analysis

### High Coverage Areas (>75%)
- Core encryption/decryption logic
- Rotor stepping mechanisms
- Plugboard functionality
- Mathematical helper functions

### Lower Coverage Areas (<75%)
- CLI interface (`promptEnigma()` function) - Not tested as it's user interaction code
- Some edge cases in branch conditions

### Coverage Notes
The uncovered code (lines 99-123) represents the command-line interface portion of the application, which handles user input/output. This code is intentionally not covered by unit tests as it:
1. Requires interactive user input
2. Is primarily I/O focused rather than business logic
3. Would require complex mocking to test effectively

The core Enigma machine logic has excellent coverage, with all critical encryption/decryption paths fully tested.

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- **100% test pass rate** demonstrates robust implementation
- **Comprehensive bug fix validation** ensures historical accuracy
- **Integration testing** validates end-to-end functionality
- **Edge case testing** covers boundary conditions
- **Historical accuracy verification** maintains cryptographic properties

### Recommendations
- Current coverage is sufficient for a cryptographic implementation
- CLI interface could be separated for better testability if needed
- All critical business logic is thoroughly tested

## Conclusion

The test suite successfully validates:
1. **Both critical bug fixes** are working correctly
2. **Encryption/decryption symmetry** is maintained
3. **Historical Enigma properties** are preserved
4. **Integration scenarios** work as expected

The implementation is now ready for production use with confidence in its correctness and historical accuracy.
